neural net project. I dont want to just copy what everyone else does. I want to figure out on my own how to do it using biology as my inspiration.

Im using Java 17 for this.

progress: the neural net itself is done. It has a simple little visual. Theres options to change stuff during a session. What im currently working on is im trying a bunch of "learning" methods that i thought of. None of them work for realzees. I just wanted to try them.
